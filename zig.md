### Projects
- [Newvim](https://github.com/overheat-org/newvim): A neovim based IDE windowed. Pretends be simple like VSCode, but editable like neovim. Newvim will have a api to handle all settings and the DOM using Lua or something else.

- [Neo](https://github.com/overheat-org/neo): A language without runtime. Your proposal is be used as transpiled language, for languages without some features and weak LSP. Pretends have a LSP better than TypeScript. Pretends have a api to handle the transpilation and create support for all needed languages for the community

- Vesper: A language really tiny and most light than lua. thinked to use with Neo for contexts needing a light language, but concerned about the lack of resources.
